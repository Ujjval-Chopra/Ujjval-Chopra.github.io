    <p>Here is the schematic for my circuit. I chose 330 ohm values for resistors because I worked with 2 red and 1 green LED
      In this we needed a 20 mA current and the voltage drop accross each was 1.8V. Using Ohm's law, I found out that the resistor
      value should be 350 ohm. 330 ohm was the nearest one

    <p>This is my actual circuit on the breadboard. I used LEDs red,green,and red.</p>
 
    <pre><code class="language-arduino">
      // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
      void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
        pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // initialize first red pin as an output.
        pinMode(12,OUTPUT); // initialize first second green pin as an output.
        pinMode(8,OUTPUT); /// initialize third red pin as an output.
      
      }
    
    
      // the loop function runs over and over again forever
      void loop() {
        digitalWrite(13, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(13, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(12, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(12, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(1000);                     // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(8, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
      }

    <!-- Answers to Questions -->
    <p>Answers to additional questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs</li>
      <img src="answer1.jpg" alt="Graph" />
      <li>How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?...</li>
     <p> We have 14 pins in the breadboard, hence we can have 14 LEDs blink individually. That would draw 20 mA * 14 = 0.28A</p>
      <li>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?...</li>
      <p> We can change the delay to 60 and at that point even if the LED blinks, we will not be able to see it.</p>
